## 🕹️ Hangman Game Using Python

### 📋 Project Description

This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic **Hangman Game** built using Python. The game randomly selects a word and the player must guess it one letter at a time, within a limited number of attempts. This version is made to run on **Google Colab** using Python's standard input/output functions.
